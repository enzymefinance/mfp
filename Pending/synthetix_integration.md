# MFP 4 - Synthetix Integration

## Description of the project

__The proposal consists of adding support for Synthetix assets, creating Synthetix Exchange adapter and price feed.__

Melon Protocol has one of the most robust technical infrastructures in the space, definitely more advanced than many other notable crypto players and it would definitely help its traction allowing trading of new assets.

On the other hand Synthetix is among the main DeFi players at the moment. For those not familiar with Synthetix, it’s a platform which enables the creation of on-chain synthetic assets (Synths) that track the value of assets in the real world. 

Examples of available assets within the platform are synthetic fiat currencies (sUSD, sAUD, sKRW, etc.), synthetic commodities such as gold (sXAU, sOIL), synthetic main cryptocurrencies (sBTC, sETH, sXRP, ..) as well as more complex assets such as equity indices (sNIKKEI, sFTSE). Moreover, the basket of crypto assets are in both long and short form.

Any synths are in the form of ERC-20 tokens and thanks to their technical architecture Synthetix Exchange allows the trading of them immediate and without slippage.

For further information please refer to:

Once delivered the technical solution anyone who launched/is going to launch a Melon fund will have access to any Synths and be able to elaborate a more sophisticated range of specialized trading strategies with a definitely wider asset allocation. 

## Synergies and benefits to the Melon ecosystem

This proposal brings several benefits to the Melon Ecosystem: 

- Integration with Synthetix and positioning in the DeFi Space
- Immediate “all together” addition of a relevant bunch of assets available for the fund managers
- Ability for fund managers to define more elaborate asset allocations and more complex trading strategies
- No slippage trading for the new assets (Synths) added to the Melon Ecosystem

## Scope of the work

The following technical activities are the main part of the work:

1. Preliminary technical assessment of latest Melon architecture
1. Build Synthetix smart contract adapter to trade synthetic assets on Synthetix
1. Build Synthetix smart contract price feed to get latest prices from Synthetix
1. Write test suites for all the contracts developed
1. Perform E2E test of the solution, creating a fund and rebalancing it in one of the testnet supported
1. Writing technical documentation of the solution

On top of this, a clear communication channel will be set-up with the core development team to discuss the solution and answer any questions.

In addition, the Synthetix team and community will be involved through co-marketing activities that will help promote the new Melon functionality making all Synthetix users (relevant traders and sophisticated investors) aware of the possibility of creating a Synths fund. 

Regarding these activities the tasks will be the following: 

1. Act as a liaison between Melon Team and Synthetix Team
1. Structurate an incentive mechanism to test out the solution
1. Elaborate together with Melon Marketing the contents used for the promotion
1. Promote the content through Synthetix Twitter and Discord server

## Token use

The grant will cover the research and technical development expenses. 

The intention is to continue to deliver solutions on top of the protocol bringing value to it without any interest to sell tokens. Different ideas have already been proposed to Mona El Isa and Sean Casey, such as gasless operations, layer 2 solutions, flashable and rehypotecable funds, redeemable assets integration (AAVE), fiat on/off ramp and others.

Our support will not be merely a technical support but we are open to participate in internal technical brainstorming whereas it’s possible, providing our strong vision based on an in-depth knowledge of most of the active DeFi protocols and above all help to promote the solutions delivered with co-marketing activities with the third-party companies involved and whereas possible real partnerships.

We remain long term committed to the project and as we demonstrated in other projects such as Synthetix we are not going to dump any tokens in the market.

This represents the first “test” project to start to work closely with Melon Team and if the delivered solution and our way of work will be appreciated by the Council we are interested to continue to build things helping to speed up Melon's growth and ensuring that the market recognizes it thanks to partnerships and technical integrations with the main protocols within the DeFi sector.

## Team

The team is composed by Emiliano Bonassi and Simone Conti.

We combine strong experiences respectively in the technology (smart contracts, decentralized applications development and automation) and in the finance industry (hedge fund, asset management, derivatives, trading).

Blending these two different but definitely complementary backgrounds together we are able to have a very clear idea of what is needed to create a successful product for investors and traders (crypto / non crypto) and to have all the technical and financial knowledge necessary to make it happen.

During the previous months we led respectively the technical and the business development of the Eidoo wallet with a strong focus on the DeFi integrations such as Compound, Fulcrum, MakerDAO, Kyber, Uniswap, Bancor, WBTC.

We actively participated in the ecosystem by providing 
our contribution to various initiatives. 

https://sai2dai.xyz/  - A tool we developed to track Maker SCD MCD migration

https://backstopsyndicate.com/ - Backstop Syndicate Initiative together Dharma and other players

http://snx.link/ - A dashboard whose goal is to bring mass adoption to Synthetix automating tedious recurring tasks and setting the autopilot to user investments.

Based on the coming market and our experience related to crypto investments we believe that __there is a huge opportunity in the creation of actively managed crypto funds and the number of new crypto funds will dramatically increase.__

For this reason we think that Melon, as leader in the on-chain asset management, is among the players who will benefit the most and we want to demonstrate our commitment to build and promote solutions on top of the protocol for two main goals:
- Increase the overall liquidity of Melon funds attracting new users / capitals
- Facilitate the experience to create a fund and invest on it
