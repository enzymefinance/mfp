# Melon Funding Proposal - Gorilla Funds


## Introduction

The Melon protocol represents a complete reimagining and retooling of the 

global investment landscape for both fund managers and investors. By

making investment funds ubiquitously accessible and drastically reducing

the costs associated with setting up / maintaining a fund Melon has cre-

ated new opportunities for the next generation of managers, investors and

asset classes to come to the forefront of the investment world. Over the

past decade the distribution of capital has moved increasingly from the

hands of the poor and working class to the wealthy. This disparity is par-

tially a function of unequal access to many investment vehicles that beneﬁt

supposedly ‘sophisticated’ or ‘qualiﬁed’ investors based on arbitrary stan-

dards. The Melon protocol will allow average investors to access and proﬁt

from a universe of assets they were previously excluded from.

In the near future every stock, a great deal of real estate, property and

even art will be digitized, fractionalized and traded in an open market. The

Melon protocol will function as the backbone of this new open and global

investment ecosystem.

To achieve the goal of being the ‘protocol layer’ of this new ﬁnancial paradigm 

Melon will need simple, elegant and engaging tools that sit on top of frame-

work and allow users to interact with this emerging ecosystem in an intuitive 

and joyful way.

Gorilla Funds will build these tools.    


### We will achieve this by:


**Developing a platform** that will allow Fund Managers to quickly get their

funds up and running by helping them build out easy to deploy consumer

facing front end web apps. This “Wordpress” of the Melon protocol will

make using Melon and its features as accessible and intuitive to use as

Wordpress has done for websites.  

**Building a Fund Explorer** web app with a simple, elegant and intuitive

UX/UI that will allow users to invest in / redeem and explore funds built on

Melon.  

**Education** - In conjunction with other Melon projects and partner edu-

cational institutions, Gorilla Funds will develop a body of educational ma-

terials that introduces the protocol to new users while explaining the basic

principles of investment and ﬁnancial responsibility. This will ensure that

users are given the opportunity to educate themselves properly in order

to operate safely, armend with the necessary knowledge base to make

prudent and independent ﬁnancial decisions.  


## Description of the project

Gorilla Funds will make interacting with and investing via the Melon proto-

col simple, intuitive and safe(er) for both fund managers and investors. To

achieve this goal Gorilla Funds will develop 2 tools:  

### Frontend Fund Builder (Fund Managers)

Easily build consumer facing web apps for Melon funds that include a one

click investment and redemption feature / Drag and Drop and a WYSIWYG-

Editor. Tiered service offerings. (Free trial followed by low monthly sub-

scription.) Subscription based feature rich Pro version for larger funds /

clients. Simple integration of fund interface into a large fund managers

existing website. Simple deployment to Netlify, and AWS. Development

of a react-library for visualizing the data for the funds and templates for

different use cases and favors.  

### Fund Explorer (Investors)

KYC new users to determine which funds / assets are available based on

jurisdiction in order to remain compliant. Identify a users risk tolerance, in-

vestment goals and investment horizon via a comprehensive risk assess-

ment questionnaire. Recommend suitable investments to new users in

order to achieve a myriad investment goals and risk tolerances based on

results. Filter and Search features that allow investors to explore funds

manually. (i.e Fund Name / Company / Manager / AUM / Fund Makeup /

Ethical Investing) Feature “Fund of the Week” based on performance met-

rics with interviews of fund managers.   


### Community Building

In addition to these tools, Gorilla Funds will pursue a growth strategy

aligned with other projects building on Melon. We will focus on expos-

ing the Melon protocol and its functionalities to as wide an audience as

possible via:

* Partnership with educational institutions and other Melon projects to

instruct, educate and inform a new generation of asset managers

and investors.

* Engagement with regulatory bodies globally to adopt a ‘compliance

ﬁrst’ approach. This will allow Gorilla Funds to stay ahead and help

in the development of the regulatory framework for this emerging ﬁ-

nancial industry.

* Community building via buidl-contests. Presence at local and inter-

national trade shows / meetups / ﬁnancial and blockchain events.

* Active community engagement through social media channels and

blog posts.  

The Gorilla Funds Alpha which we built during the Kyber DeFi Hackathon

is a basic but functional representation of what we hope to achieve.

This is just the beginning.  


## Synergies and beneﬁts to the ecosystem

The greater the network effect of the Melon Protocol the more impactful it

will be globally. Gorilla Funds primary goal will be developing UX/UI inter-

faces that are elegant, simple and a joy to use for both fund managers and

investors. This will allow all users to focus on the functionality and beneﬁts

of the protocol itself without needing any speciﬁc technical expertise.

### Compliance First Approach

Gorilla Funds adopts a “Rising tide lifts all boats”. philosophy. As part of

our core ethos the majority of our code will always be open source. We

also believe however; that open source does not mean unregulated. The

success of the Melon Protocol is aligned with transparency and openness

both in it’s codebase and to its community and supporters. It is also imper-

ative that projects building on Melon engage openly and proactively with

the regulatory bodies that will inevitably provide guidance as this emerg-

ing ﬁnancial paradigm takes shape. By actively approaching and engag-

ing with regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions we intend to operate, Gorilla

Funds will establish itself as THE compliant onramp for new investors /

fund managers in the Digital Asset Management Space. The positive re-

lationships we intend to foster with legislators and regulators will establish

a deep and signiﬁcant competitive advantage over the long term both for

Gorilla Funds and the Melon protocol.  

As per our stated goal of promoting the widespread adoption of the Melon

ecosystem as a whole, Gorilla Funds will always share knowledge gained

and lessons learned with other projects building on the protocol in order to

bring about regulatory clarity.

## Request for Funding

To achieve our goals on time and within budget, Gorilla Funds 

is asking the Melon Council for funding in the total amount of 

75000 MLN as of the current daily price over two years. These funds 

are to be released in yearly tranches of 50000 MLN and 25000 MLN. 

The grants are used to cover the following costs:

#### Yearly Budget Considerations:

| Position |
|----------| 
|  Jakob Sievers (CEO / Founder)  | 
| Dave Clancy (CMO)  |  
|  Senior Full Stack Developer (FT) | 
|  Front End Developer (PT) | 
| Marketing / PR  | 
|  Travel / Show / Conference / Transportation |
|  Legal / Accounting | 
| Office | 


Gorilla Funds is currently in dis-

cussion with other sources of ﬁnance to ﬁll any funding gaps.  

In addition to our MFP, Gorilla Funds is seeking alternate sources of ﬁnancing

that includes application for grants such as the Blockpool Open Call for

Blockchain and Decentralized Ledger Technology (BDLT) startups in Eu-

rope and the Blockchers partnership program. We also intend to contact

private investors once a simple proof-of-concept is ready and are exploring

the opportunity to engage with VC funds operating in the blockchain and

DLT space. We believe that the added legitimacy brought to the Gorilla

Funds project by the support given by the Melon Council will allow Gorilla

Funds to source the necessary ﬁnancial support to develop a robust and

functional MVP ready for market.  


### Token Vesting

Gorilla Funds is long MLN.

As an indication of our long term commitment to the Melon protocol and in

order to align the interest of Gorilla Funds with the Melon community we

intend to escrow 40% of any MLN tokens received for two years from the

date of reception. Gorilla Funds will partner with private investors to cover

funding gaps.  

Further, Gorilla Funds is committed to working with the Melon Council in

selling any signiﬁcant amount of MLN tokens necessary to ﬁnance this

project OTC, thereby reducing the volatility and increasing the legitimacy

of the MLN token.  


## Monetization

Gorilla Funds will offer its services in a tiered fashion. Individual and low

AUM users of the Front End Builder will have the option of a free trial fol-

lowed by a basic monthly subscription. The tiers of service will include

Personal / Professional / Enterprise and Custom. Investors will be free to

use the Fund Explorer. Gorilla Funds may look to develop advertising or

marketing partnerships with high quality projects who wish to gain expo-

sure to the Digital Asset Management space. While monthly fees (as well

as custom work) will be payable in any form the client chooses, Gorilla

Funds will offer a discount (between 5-10% TBD) if users choose to pay in

MLN tokens.
